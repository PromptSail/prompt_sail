## Why we chose MongoDB



## Database schema

There are three main objects in the database: `projects`, `transactions`, and `settings`. Each of them has a similar structure. 

The `projects` table is the most important because it is the parent of the other two. 

The `transactions` table is the most numerous because each user request creates a new transaction.
