## What is Prompt Sail?


Prompt Sail is a self-hosted application that captures and logs all interactions with LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Cohere, and others. It is a proxy between your framework of choice (LangChain, OpenAI etc) and LLM provider API. 

For **developers**, it offers a way to analyze and optimize API prompts. 

For **Project managers** can gain insights into project and experiment costs. 

For **Business owners** can ensure compliance with regulations and maintain governance over prompts and responses.

## Key Features

1. **Transparent Logging** 
It captures and logs all interactions with  LLM APIs, providing a comprehensive record of prompts and responses.

2. **Optimization and Analysis**
By providing a concise and detailed view of all interactions, developers can analyze and refine their prompts.

3. **Cost Insights** 
Project managers can track and analyze the costs associated with each project and experiment, enabling better budget management.

4. **Compliance and Governance**

Empowers business owners to maintain control over instructions, chat messages, and other interactions with LLM APIs. This enables the implementation of standards and policies, identification of misuse, and detection of non-compliant content.


5. **Easy Integration** 

Prompt Sail seamlessly integrates into your workflow and used libraries. Just modify the `base_url` parameter when creating your provider API object.

6. **Searchable Database*

All prompts and responses are stored in a searchable database, making finding and analyzing specific interactions easy. You can export the data for further analysis.

7. **User-Friendly Interface**

Simple and intuitive UI lets you easily view and filter your transactions (prompts and responses) by project, API provider, LLM model, or tags.
