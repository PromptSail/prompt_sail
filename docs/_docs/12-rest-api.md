# Overview


We provide a RESTful API to interact with the PromptSail backend. The API allows you to perform various operations such as creating and managing projects (CRUD), viewing and interactinng with stored transactions, and accessing AI models and providers. 
This allows you to integrate and automate project creation, AI providers configuration, and transaction management with your existing systems and tools.


When you [deploy the PromptSail backend](https://promptsail.com/docs/deploy-promptsail-cookbook), the swagger documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
