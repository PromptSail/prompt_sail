## Prompt Sail Demo


The Demo provides an insight into Prompt Sail's user interface. It allows you to explore the layout of the organization's and project's dashboards. You can also find out what details of stored transactions (Gen AI API calls) are logged and what statistics are provided for transactions, projects and organization.

**No installation or account creation is required, making it a straightforward process.**

In the Demo, you also have the opportunity to test the logging of your Gen AI API calls. The easiest way to proceed with this is to follow the instructions in the section [Make your first Gen AI API call](https://promptsail.github.io/prompt_sail/docs/quick-start-guide/#make-your-first-api-call).


**Warning**: The Prompt Sail Demo is public, so avoid including any sensitive information in your prompts when testing it. Each new deployment of [**Demo page**](https://try-promptsail.azurewebsites.net/) resets the database, causing projects and transactions in the demo to be regularly deleted.
