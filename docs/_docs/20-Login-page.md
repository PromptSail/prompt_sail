The Login Page allows users to authenticate and access their accounts within the application. This documentation provides an overview of the login process and details the functionality available on the Login Page.
This page is available at `localhost:80`. You will be redirected to the `/signin` subpage if the application does not find or recognise the **access token** in the browser's storage. To create an **access token** you must select one of the SSO login options available on the current webpage and log in correctly

For more information, see [SSO Configuration](/docs/sso-configuration/)
