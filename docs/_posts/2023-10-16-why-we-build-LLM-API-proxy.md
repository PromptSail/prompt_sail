Because we can :)

We're thrilled to introduce Prompt Sail, our open-source LLM API proxy! Our journey to build Prompt Sail was driven by the challenges we faced and the opportunities we saw in our daily work with language model APIs.

As developers and researchers, we constantly experiment with different prompts in LLMs. However, we found a significant gap in the tools available for observability and monitoring during these experiments. This became even more evident when we tried to deploy our models in production-ready environments, where governance is crucial.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was cost monitoring. The costs of running experiments with different prompts can quickly escalate, and without a proper tracking mechanism, managing these expenses becomes extremely difficult.

But our journey wasn't just about overcoming our own challenges. We believe in the power of open source and the immense value it brings to the community. With Prompt Sail, we aim to create a tool that benefits everyone working with LLMs. We envision a platform where developers can collaborate, share their experiences, and collectively improve the tool.

Our core values - openness, collaboration, and feedback - are the pillars of Prompt Sail. They are reflected in every aspect of the project. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey, contribute to the project, and help us make Prompt Sail the best it can be. Let's sail together towards a brighter future in language model APIs!
