## Prompt Sail is no longer maintain


### Charting a New Course: Sunsetting PromptSail and Unveiling a PyTorch Adventure!

Ahoy, sailors and navigators of the digital sea!

First and foremost, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has been part of the PromptSail journey. Your support, feedback, and enthusiasm have been the wind in our sails, and we're incredibly grateful for the community that formed around our project.

However, all voyages must eventually reach a port. We've made the difficult decision to drop anchor on PromptSail, and the project will no longer be actively maintained as we shift our focus to a new, exciting endeavor.

### A New Horizon: The Ultimate PyTorch Course

While one chapter closes, another—crackling with energy and possibility—opens. We are thrilled to announce our new project: a comprehensive, free online **[PyTorch course](https://pytorchcourse.com)**!

This isn't just another tutorial. We are diving deep into the core building blocks of modern AI, from the fundamentals of tensors to the advanced architectures that power today's Transformers and Diffusion models.

### Meet Professor Torchenstein!

Guiding you on this new adventure is the brilliant, if slightly eccentric, **Professor Victor py Torchenstein**. With a spark of genius in his eyes and a laugh that echoes in the halls of his lab, the Professor believes that mastering PyTorch is the key to computational glory. He's ready to turn you from a mere student into a true PyTorch master, or as he calls them, his "acolytes."

He was last heard muttering, *"They called me mad! And they were right! Madly efficient at PyTorch!"*

So, while we say a fond farewell to PromptSail, we invite you to join us and Professor Torchenstein on a new, thrilling quest. It's time to build empires... of code!

Set your course for **[pytorchcourse.com](https://pytorchcourse.com)** and let the learning begin!
