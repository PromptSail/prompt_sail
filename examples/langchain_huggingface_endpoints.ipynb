    "1. Add your Huggingface API key in ```.env``` file as ```HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN```. You can get it from [huggingface settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). We recommend \"write\" option.\n",
    "2. Add huggingface provider into your project (in example we will use ```models-playground``` project). There is example structure of Huggingface provider:\n",
