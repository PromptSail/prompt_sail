# How to provide fake data
We have specially prepared an endpoint for this purpose, which allows you to add a selected number of transactions to 
the database (we recommend that you use a test database). Here is the link: 
`http://localhost:8000/api/only_for_purpose/mock_transactions?count=100000&days_back=30`.
**Count** is the number of transactions you want to add, and **days_back** is responsible for how many days back from 
today will be the starting range for generating transaction dates. You can use it for example using postman, swagger 
docks on `http://localhost:8000/docs#/default/mock_transactions_api_only_for_purpose_mock_transactions_post` or using 
curl.
